## Introducing support for BigCommerce!

We are incredibly excited to announce support for customers using <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com" target="_blank">BigCommerce</a> as their eCommerce platform! The new provider is available today and supports using a built-in Shipping Provider, making use of the shipping configuration you've already set up in BigCommerce. It currently supports our Starter and Professional subscription tiers, with upcoming support soon to be released for our Enterprise tier.

This new agnoStack integration replaces the existing <Anchor isExternal href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/bigcommerce-for-zendesk-support/" target="_blank">BigCommerce for Zendesk Support</Anchor> plugin developed by Zendesk and <a href="https://presencepg.com/">Presence Group</a> that is being sunset and will soon be removed from the Marketplace. The new app can be installed side-by-side with the existing plugin to ensure all is working properly before disabling and removing the previous app.
