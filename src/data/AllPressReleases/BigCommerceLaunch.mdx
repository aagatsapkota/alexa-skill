__Chicago, IL, USA - March 5th, 2020__ - agnoStack, provider of world's first platform agnostic, omni-channel commerce solution built natively on Zendesk, is announcing support for any BigCommerce customers leveraging Zendesk's Support Suite. This new plugin enables organizations leveraging BigCommerce's highly-extensible SaaS eCommerce solution to further improve their customer's omni-channel experience and provide best-in-class customer service.

<br/>

BigCommerce allows customers to create differentiated shopping experiences, helping brands of all sizes accelerate growth, without the typical complexity of many other eCommerce platforms. Zendesk's Customer Support and Experience platform provides industry leading capabilities for brands to build the best customer experiences that span well beyond initial purchase. Their SaaS software for support, sales, and customer engagement is designed to create better customer relationships across all channels.

<br/>

"The BigCommerce integration from agnoStack not only allows support agents to get a complete view of the purchase history and customer details directly from the Zendesk unified dashboard, but also will have the capability for the agent to transact on behalf of a customer, directly from Zendesk", said Jerome Agnola, director of technology alliances at Zendesk. "We are excited to see partners, such as agnoStack, embrace and innovate on the Zendesk platform to provide excellent customer experience for shoppers."

<br/>

Ensuring that great 'customer experiences' aren't just about great 'purchase experiences' is a core part of agnoStackâ€™s mission. "Our unified solution within Zendesk, can help brands bring more innovative commerce experiences to life through BigCommerce." noted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamgrohs/" target="_blank">Adam Grohs</a>, Founder and CEO at agnoStack. "Zendesk enables amazing support experiences and BigCommerce allows tremendous innovation around the purchase experience. We add the missing link to bring those two disjointed experiences together in service of the end customer. Our plugin solves that issue, removing difficult barriers to brands who want to truly innovate on how they interact with their customers."

<br/>

The new native BigCommerce plugin for Zendesk Support enhances your agent's support experience by displaying commerce data alongside Zendesk ticket information, providing a robust Omni-Channel solution. It saves your agents time because they no longer need to switch between BigCommerce and Zendesk to connect a ticket to an order for support.

<br/>

With just a few clicks, customer service reps can now have quick access to:
* View and Search Order History
* Look up Order Details
* Quickly lookup Customer Details
* Perform a Rapid Re-Order Transaction
* Perform a Catalog Browse/Search
* Complete an "Order On Behalf Of" Transaction
