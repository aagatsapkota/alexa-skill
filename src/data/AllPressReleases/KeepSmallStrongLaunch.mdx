[agnoStack](/) is a proud, founding member of <a href="https://keepsmallstrong.org" target="_blank">KeepSmallStrong</a> - an inspired collective brought to you by incredible humans, who work for some amazing companies, lending their individual time to help save thousands of small businesses from closing their doors due to the covid-19 crisis.

<br/>

__Chicago, IL, USA - March 25th, 2020__ - agnoStack, provider of world's first platform agnostic, omni-channel commerce solution built natively on Zendesk, has joined forces with the industry's leading e-commerce experts including <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/" target="_blank">CapGemini</a>, <a href="https://astoundcommerce.com/" target="_blank">AstoundCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.pfscommerce.com/" target="_blank">PFS</a>/<a href="https://www.liveareacx.com/" target="_blank">LiveArea</a>, <a href="https://www.pixelmedia.com/" target="_blank">PixelMedia</a> and others to leverage their industry expertise and help save small businesses affected by covid-19.

<br/>

This pandemic has hit the small businesses sector particularly hard. We are collaborating with a number of other industry e-commerce providers to offer free support for launching online storefronts, setting up national fulfillment/local delivery, as well improving marketing efforts to ensure these business not only survive, but come out of this thriving. If you run a small business that could use help, have a favorite local business in need of support, or want to get involved in the movement - learn more at <a href="https://keepsmallstrong.org" target="_blank">keepsmallstrong.org</a>.

"Those of us with the resources and ability to help should. It’s our duty to protect and support those searching for answers," says PixelMEDIA co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasobrey/" target="_blank">Thomas Obrey</a>. "Whether that’s a shoulder to lean on, an ear to bend, a bit of inspiration, or a shared tear because we’re all in this together. Our goal is to help, guide, and inspire. If not us, then who? Lean in, ask questions, and share your story. We are listening."

<br/>

The urge to help was initially ignited by agnoStack CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamgrohs/" target="_blank">Adam Grohs</a>, who saw one of his favorite Miami bakeries, <a href="https://www.lartisanebakery.com/" target="_blank">L’Artisane Creative Bakery by Carolina Molea</a>, post how overnight it had gone from booming to struggling. The owner’s impassioned plea to her customers and community for support struck a chord, and Grohs reached out to the owner to lend a hand. After 20 years working in e-commerce at global agencies, he offered to help them set up the ability to sell their goods online, and they launched online purchasing and delivery within days.

<br/>

Grohs and agnoStack CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-bowers-72516422" target="_blank">Rob Bowers</a> began calling old friends, former colleagues, and even some typically fierce industry competitors he knew would want to make a difference. By the next day, he had gathered 10 (and a day later it would more than double) leaders at companies across the e-commerce, agency, and consulting landscapes who were ready to lend their expertise to help save our local communities and small businesses.

<br/>

LiveArea Executive Vice President and General Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibutler/" target="_blank">Jim Butler</a> noted "These businesses are in survival mode — and some may not make it without assistance. This is why LiveArea is lending our talent and support as a founding member of #KeepSmallStrong, a collective of commerce leaders who have banded together to help save small business in America.”
