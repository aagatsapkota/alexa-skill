## General Availability for Magento 2

We're happy to finally announce our support for customers using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/commerce/magento.html" target="_blank">Magento 2</a>/<a href="https://www.adobe.com/commerce/magento/enterprise.html" target="_blank">Adobe Commerce Cloud</a>. This extends our existing agnoStack support for Magento 1 customers with the new M2 version supporting using a built-in Shipping Provider, making use of the shipping configuration you've already set up in Magento.

<br/>

The new Magento 2 provider currently supports our Starter and Professional subscription tiers, with upcoming support soon to be released for our Enterprise tier.

## Introducing support for BigCommerce

We are incredibly excited to announce support for customers using <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com" target="_blank">BigCommerce</a> as their eCommerce platform! The new provider is available today and supports using a built-in Shipping Provider, making use of the shipping configuration you've already set up in BigCommerce. It currently supports our Starter and Professional subscription tiers, with upcoming support soon to be released for our Enterprise tier.

Below are a few key highlights that we're particularly excited to share (in addition to BigCommerce & Magento 2):

<br/>

## Enhanced Filter Orders

<div class="columns">
  <div class="full">
    We've further enhanced the filtering functionality on the Orders List screen to now add the ability to search by fields other than the order id. We've also added the ability to set a specific prefix on your filter to only filter by that specific field (e.g. <code>amount:</code>).

      data-canonical-src="/images/features-orders-filter-screenshot.png"
    />

## Order Search

<div class="columns">
  <div class="third left">
    <img
      class="border"
      width="100%"
      src="/images/features-order-search-screenshot.png"
      data-canonical-src="/images/features-order-search-screenshot.png"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="full">
    For customer's subscribed to our Professional tier (and above), we've heard your feedback and extended the Orders List screen to now not only allow you to filter existing orders for the ticket requester's email, but also to be able to search directly by order id if no results are found for the active customer.
