Groups are used to create collections of agents based on criteria those agents have in common. All agents must belong to at least one group, and they can belong to multiple groups.

<br />

To set up the Zendesk groups, please follow the steps below to install and configuration the plugin into your Zendesk subdomain.

<br />

## Creating groups

How you set up your groups depends on how you want to define your workflow and organize your agents. You might create groups by skill (software vs hardware) or to reflect the organizations they serve (for example, a group might serve only customers in a certain region or time zone).

<br />

Administrators can create groups, agents cannot.

<br />

**To create a group**

<br />

1. Click the **Admin** icon (<img src="/images/zendesk-group-admin_icon.png" data-canonical-src="/images/zendesk-group-admin_icon.png" />) in the sidebar, then select **People**.
1. Click **Add group**.
1. Enter a group name.
1. Select the agents you want to add to the group.
1. If you want this group to be the default group that all new agents are added to, select **Make default group**.
1. Click **Create group**.

<br />
Administrators can view and manage all groups by selecting Groups on the People page.

<br />
**ADDING AGENTS TO GROUPS**
<br />

<br />
After you create an agent you can add them to either pre-existing groups or assign them to new groups. For information on how to create a new agent, see [Adding end-users, agents, and administrators](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661986-Adding-end-users-agents-and-administrators#topic_h43_2k2_yg).
<br />

<br />
Agents are added or removed from groups via the groups editor, accessed from their profile page.
<br />

<br />
**Adding agents to a group**
<br />

<br />

1. On an agent's profile page, click the **Groups** field.
1. Select the group you want to add the agent to. A default group will automatically be assigned. See [Changing the default group](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661966-Creating-managing-and-using-groups#topic_mq1_h13_dt) for information on how to change an agent's default group.
1. Click **Close**.

5. Your new group will be created with the agent added.

<br />
**Changing an agents default group**
<br />

<br />
All of your agents will automatically be assigned to the first group you've created, but you can change individual agent's default group through their user profile.
<br />

<br />

1. Select the agent's profile page.
1. Click the **Groups** field.

<br />
